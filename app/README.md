## Setting Up Step Bible

Check that Node.js is installed:

```
node --version
```

Check if Yarn is installed:

```
yarn --version
```

Install Yarn if needed: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

Install some global dependences:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install -g typescript
```

Check out the repo:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/tyndale/BibleEngine.git
cd BibleEngine
```

Build Typescript files, and ignore any warnings or errors:

```
yarn --cwd core build
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd ~/BibleEngine
yarn install
```

Copy a pre-built database into the repo:

_need a database? Ask Dan Bennett for one, or build one using some instructions further below_

```
cp ~/Downloads/bible.db ~/BibleEngine/app/assets/
```

Start the app to see everything in action:

```
cd ~/BibleEngine/app
expo start
```

Change the Connection mode to "Tunnel". This allows you to run the app on your phone, even if your phone is on a different network.

For Android, scan the QR code on your phone, or for iOS, have it text a link to you.

1. Change color: try ReadingView.tsx, background: backgroundColor to 'magenta'
1. Verify that the change takes < 5 seconds to load
1. On your phone or simulator, close Expo and reopen if it gets stuck on 100%
1. Celebrate ðŸ˜€

## Upgrading

We move quickly, and a lot can change! If you need to upgrade your repo, follow these instructions.

Reset everything to master, and remove untracked files like node_modules:

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git clean -xdff
```

Rebuild the Typescript files:

```
yarn --cwd core build || true
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Start Expo to make sure everything worked:

```
cd ~/BibleEngine/app
expo start
```

## Building a Database

Want a database to run in the app? Follow these steps!

Note: for the lexicons, you'll need access to some copyrighted material that's not checked into this repo.

Build, for instance, an ESV database from a Sword module:

```
cp ~/Downloads/ESV2016_th.zip ~/BibleEngine/importers/src/osis-sword-module/data
cd ~/BibleEngine/importers/src/osis-sword-module
npx ts-node src/importer.ts
```

Import copyrighted lexicon materials:

```
mkdir -p ~/BibleEngine/importers/src/step-lexicon/data/
cp ~/Downloads/hebrew_lexicon.txt ~/BibleEngine/importers/src/step-lexicon/data/
cp ~/Downloads/greek_lexicon.txt ~/BibleEngine/importers/src/step-lexicon/data/
```

Add lexicon content to the database:

```
cd ~/BibleEngine/importers
npx ts-node src/step-lexicon/importer.ts
```

Inspect the resulting file, if you'd like:

```
open ~/BibleEngine/importers/output/bible.db
```

Copy the database into the app:

```
cp ~/BibleEngine/importers/output/bible.db ~/BibleEngine/app/assets/
```

Start Expo to make sure everything worked:

```
cd ~/BibleEngine/app
expo start
```
