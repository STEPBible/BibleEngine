ENCODING
========
the source files are not in UTF-8, so when changing them, take care that editor is using the correct encoding (windows-1252, or at least latin1 / iso-8859-1)

ERRORS
======
1Mo 19,22: "*" missing for note
5Mo 3,11: "*" missing for "Sarg aus Eisenstein"
Ps 1: notes for 1,1 & 1,2 at the wrong place
Ps 78: multiple notes at the wrong place
Ps 95,8: note at the wrong place
Ps 132,6: note "132,6 <em>von ihr</em>. Gemeint ist die Bundeslade." has no related text (and is missing ":" after reference)
Ps: section missing for "73-89: Drittes Buch"
Jes 11,10: wrong verse seperator in note
Jes 63,19: verse overlaps to chapter 64, which needs to be indicated by a '<span class="vers">63,19</span>' before the overlapping portion
Kla 4,1: missing reference at beginning of note
Dan 12,7: note in the wrong order
Mt 13,32: note has wrong reference ("Mt 13,23")
1Tim 5,22: reference to 2. Timotheus 1,6 misses anchor tag #1
3Jo: duplicate "<p>" at beginning of bible text
3Jo: spelling error in title

NORMALIZATIONS
==============
Mt 20,6.9: to have this attached at both verses, note has to be duplicated to Mt 20,9 (with an added "*") and each note should only reference the single verse)
Lk 22,43: since the note marker is at verse 44, the reference in the note needs to point to that

MANUAL PREPARATIONS BEFORE PARSING
==================================
<img src="note.png" width="10" height="10">* => <span class="sela">[SELA]*</span>
<img src="note.png" width="10" height="10"> => <span class="sela">[SELA]</span>
(within the importer "[SELA]" gets replaced by the "♪"-sign - since NeÜ source files are not in unicode we can't do it there)

<a href="[a-z0-9.]*?#[0-9]{1,3}">(.*?)</a> => $1
(a lot of a-tags only link part of the reference, some refs are not linked at all. we remove all of them and use ref-detection to properly catch and link all of them.)

index.html: remove all <a href="#vorwort"> /^\</a> 
(optional, removes those characters from heading titles)
